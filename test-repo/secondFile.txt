Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance.
Another heartache - another failed romance.
On and on...
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess i'm learning
I must be warmer now..
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now.
Outside the dawn is breaking,
I'll top the bill!
I'll overkill!
But my smile, still, stays on!
Yeah! oh oh oh
